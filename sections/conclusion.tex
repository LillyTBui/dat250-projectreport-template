\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We conclude that Redis is a better choice than Neo4j when it comes to caching.
Redis has a better performance than Neo4j in terms of speed.
This is supported by the results from our experiment,
indicating that the average response time in Redis is significantly lower than Neo4j.
When it comes to ease of use,
our experience from implementing both technologies concludes that Redis is much simpler to work with than Neo4j.
Even though we struggled with implementing both technologies into our application,
Neo4j had more severe issues than Redis.
And the issues were not easy to pinpoint, due to the lack of experience and knowledge with using Neo4j.
On the other hand, Redis was something we have encountered before, giving us some familiarity with the technology.
Despite these challenges, there was a steep learning curve getting to know a completely new technology.
Not only did we dive into an unfamiliar database structure, but we also learned a new query language.
Overall, after finishing this project,
we have a greater understanding of how to evaluate different technologies to determine their relevance and efficiency.
In addition, we extend our knowledge by adding another technology to our tool box.
